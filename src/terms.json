      "definition": "Attestation in crypto refers to the process of verifying the authenticity or validity of a piece of information or a transaction on a blockchain network. Attestation is an important aspect of blockchain technology, as it helps to ensure the integrity and security of the network. In general, attestation involves a trusted third-party, or attester, verifying the authenticity of a transaction or piece of information. This can include verifying the identity of users on the network, verifying the accuracy of data, or validating the authenticity of a digital signature. One example of attestation in crypto is the use of digital signatures to authenticate transactions on a blockchain network. Digital signatures use public key cryptography to verify the identity of the sender and ensure that the transaction has not been tampered with. Another example of attestation in crypto is the use of Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms, which rely on validators to attest to the validity of transactions on the network. Validators are responsible for verifying transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain, and they are rewarded with cryptocurrency for their efforts.

Some people may use 'coins' as shorthand for 'bitcoin'; the immortal aphorism 'not your keys, not your coins' refers to bitcoins. Another thing to keep in mind is that, while coins are put forward as some sort of representation of value, that value can vary wildly from one 'coin' to another. A coin may represent the value of the computational resources of the network, or it may be 'pegged' to represent fiat currency value, or it may float according to the value placed on immaterial resources like NFTs, membership, or digital goods, to name a few.",

Additionally, there are so-called on-ramp providers, who could be compared to currency brokers, exchanging traditional “fiat” money for cryptocurrencies, and do not hold customer’s funds “on deposit” the way a centralized exchange does.

By way of example: if the world ‘Apple’ was your private key, then it was encrypted three letters down the alphabet, your new encrypted key would be ‘Dssoh’.

Each Ethereum public address is unique and is associated with a private key that allows the owner of the address to sign and authorize transactions. The public address is derived from the private key using a mathematical algorithm, and it can be shared with others to receive payments or tokens.  When sending Ethereum or tokens, users need to specify the recipient's public address as the destination for the transaction. Once the transaction is confirmed by the network, the Ethereum or tokens are transferred to the recipient's address.",

In order to have any degree of usability when it comes to allowing users to do some things, like send transactions, but not others, like steal other peoples’ tokens, cryptographic technology is used. In particular, a design paradigm known as ‘public/private key pairs’ is employed to ensure users can interact with others on the network as they wish, while keeping their own account secure.  These key pairs consist of two long strings of alphanumeric characters. A public key can be derived mathematically from its corresponding private key, but the inverse is not true: it is mathematically impossible to derive a private key from its corresponding public key. This allows, for example, users to have a public wallet address that anyone can use to send them tokens, with the peace of mind that as long as they properly keep the corresponding private key safe, those tokens cannot be stolen.

While applicable in many realms of technology, this becomes of particular interest in public blockchain systems: how do we ensure that we can agree on the current state of the network when there is an incentive, often a significant financial incentive, to subvert the state of the network for one's own profit? On a more basic level, if we're coordinating a network running around the world on all kinds of different hardware and software, there are all kinds or problems that can occur that hinder the network's ability to reach consensus on its current state. Therefore, a network that has been designed and implemented to be resistant to these sorts of failures, either due to malicious intent or technical failure, is said to be Byzantine Fault Tolerant.",
